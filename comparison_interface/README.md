# Compress and Compare Frontend

To start the client interface, first install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the client hot-reload server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dashboard should now be visible at [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173).

To run the client server without hot-reloading and expose it on a public port (e.g. 0.0.0.0), run:

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview-public
```
